# Overview Of GitHub Actions
__GitHub Actions__ is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your _build_, _test_, and _deployment pipeline_. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production. Launched in 2018, __GitHub Actions__ help developers automate their workflowsâ€”all within GitHub. Unlike other automation tools and features, GitHub Actions goes beyond the typical applications of testing, building, and deploying. Instead, it offers the flexibility to automate any __webhook__.
