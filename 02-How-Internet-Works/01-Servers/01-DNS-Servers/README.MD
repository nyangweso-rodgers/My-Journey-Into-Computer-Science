# DNS Servers

- These servers are used to convert domain names to IP addresses. **DNS servers** are a critical component of the domain name system (DNS)

- **Examples**:
  - BIND and
  - Microsoft DNS Server

# How DNS servers Work

- We use **IP addresses** to visit websites on the internet. Since humans cannot easily remember IP addresses to visit a website, a global phone book was created. The phone book maintains mappings of all **domain names** to **IP addresses**.
- A **client** forwards a request with the **domain name** to the **DNS server**. And **DNS servers** reply with the actual **IP address** associated with that domain name.
