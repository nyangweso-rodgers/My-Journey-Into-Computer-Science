# Introduction to HTML
Unlike a scripting language or programming language that uses scripts to perform functions, a __markup language__ uses tags to identify content.

# Definition of Terms
1. __HTML elements__: an HTML element is written using a start tag and an end tag and with content in between.__HTML documents__ consists of HTML nested elements. 	in HTML, most elements are defined as __block-level__ or __inline elements__.

2. __HTML Attributes__: attributes provide additional information (modifies the tag), about an element or a tag, while also modifying them. most attributes have a value; the value modifies the attributez. e.g., width, align, src for the $<$ img $>$ tags.

# Semantic HTML
__Semantic HTML__ adds essential meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. This lets web browsers, search engines, screen readers, RSS readers, and ultimately users understand it in a better way.

* _Benefits of using Semantic HTML_:
    * _Improve site's SEO position_:  search engine crawlers need to distinguish between different types of data. Semantic tags tell what type of information is on a web page. Meaningful content in a logical hierarchy can easily rank your page higher.
    * _Help your site more accessible_: there are many users who depend upon a screen reader software to access the internet. Using a proper semantic tags would help them in easier navigation through these screen readers. This way, the site would be more accessible
    * _Closer to natural language_: though semantic tags won't change the way text is displayed, but they are closer to natural language. When a project grows, more pages are added. Having semantic tags, it's easier to maintain and orient new developers.
