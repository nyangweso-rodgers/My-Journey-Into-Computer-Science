# Introduction to Data Structures
* __Data Structure__ is the arrangement of data in computer's memory such that it could make the data quickly available to the processor for required calculations. 

* The functional definition of a __data structure__ is known as __ADI__ (__Abstract Data Type__) which is independent  of implementation. The implementation  part is left for developers who decide which technology better suits to their project needs.

# Definition of Terms
1. __The Node__: This is the most basic building block for many common data structures. The node fulfills two functions:
    - _provides a mechanism to contain a piece of data_ e.g., an integer value 7.
    - _it provides a means of connecting itself to other nodes via object reference pointer_.This object reference point is referred to as _Next Pointer_.

2. __Trees__: are similary to __Linked list__ in that they chain together nodes of data, but they do it in a hierarchical rather than in a linear manner.

# Classification of Data Structures
1. Linear Structures
    * Arrays
    * Linked List
    * Stacks
    * Queues
    
2. Hierarchial Structures
    * trees
    * graphs
    * heaps
