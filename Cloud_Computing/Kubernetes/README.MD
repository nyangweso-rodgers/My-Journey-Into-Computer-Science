# Docker vs Kubernetes
* __Docker__ is a file format for containers and open-source technology to run applications from anywhere. __Kubernetes__ coordinates and schedules  many containers, and ensures that they communicate properly with each other. 

* __Docker__ has its own container orchestration service, __Docker Swarm__. Here, however, the winner is clear: __Kubernetes__ is way more extensive than __Docker Swarm__. Kubernetes can run across an entire cluster of machines, whereas Docker Swarm runs on a single node only.
