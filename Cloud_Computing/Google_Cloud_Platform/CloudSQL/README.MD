# Restrictions of Cloud SQL
* Size limit for individual instances is 500GB
* User defined functions are not supported
* The following MySQL statements are not supported:
    - LOAD DATA INFILE
        - Note: LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE is supported.
    - SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE/DUMPFILE
    - INSTALL/UNINSTALL PLUGIN ...
    - CREATE FUNCTION ...
    - LOAD_FILE()
* The SUPER privilege is not supported.
* The following MySQL functions are not supported:
    - SHA2()
* The following MySQL Client Program features are not supported:
    - [mysqlimport](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqlimport.html) without using the --local option. This is due to the LOAD DATA INFILE restriction. If you need to load data remotely, use the Cloud SQL [import function](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/import-export#importing)
    - [mysqlimport](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html) using the --tab option or options that are used with --tab. This is because the [FILE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_file) privilege is not granted for instance users. All other mysqlimport options are supported.
