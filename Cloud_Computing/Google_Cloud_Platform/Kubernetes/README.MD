# Kubernetes

# What is Kubernetes?
__Kubernetes__ is an open-source __container orchestration__ platform that automates _deploying_, _managing_, and _scaling_ containerized applications. __Kubernetes__ uses something called "__container runtimee__" to work. A popular choice is __Docker__.

# How Kubernetes Works?
A __kubernetes cluster__ consists of woker machines, called __nodes__, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one __worker node__. Hence, if a __node__ fails, your application will still be accessible from other nodes as a cluster, multiple nodes are grouped.
