# What is an App Service?
__Azure App Service__ is an HTTP-based service that enables you to build and host many types of web-based solutions without managing infrastructure. For example, you can host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in several supported programming languages. Applications developed in .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python can run in and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

We aim to create a website in less than the time it takes to eat lunch. Therefore, we're not going to write any code and will instead deploy a predefined application from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.

## What is the Microsoft Azure Marketplace?
The __Microsoft Azure Marketplace__ is an online store that hosts applications that are certified and optimized to run in Azure. Many types of applications are available, ranging from AI + Machine Learning to Web applications. As you'll see in a couple of minutes, deployments from the store are done via the __Azure portal__ using a wizard-style user interface. This user interface makes evaluating different solutions easy.

We're going to use one of the WordPress application options from the Azure Marketplace for our website.

## Creating resources in Azure
Typically, the first thing we'd do is to create a resource group to hold all the things that we need to create. The resource group allows us to administer all the services, disks, network interfaces, and other elements that potentially make up our solution as a unit. We can use the Azure portal to create and manage our solution's resource groups. However, keep in mind that you can also manage resources via a command line using the Azure CLI. The Azure CLI is a useful option should you need to automate the process in the future.
