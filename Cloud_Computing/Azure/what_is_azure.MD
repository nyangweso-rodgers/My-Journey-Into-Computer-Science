# What is Azure?
__Azure__ is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. __Azure__ gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

## What is cloud computing?
__Cloud computing__ is the delivery of computing services over the Internet using a __pay-as-you-go__ pricing model. Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your data center, you rent them for the time that you need them. The cloud provider takes care of maintaining the underlying infrastructure for you.

## What can I do on Azure?
__Azure__ provides over 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

Many teams start exploring the cloud by moving their existing applications to virtual machines that run in Azure. While migrating your existing apps to virtual machines is a good start, the cloud is more than just "a different place to run your virtual machines".

For example, Azure provides AI and machine-learning services that can naturally communicate with your users through vision, hearing, and speech. It also provides storage solutions that dynamically grow to accommodate massive amounts of data. Azure services enable solutions that are not feasible without the power of the cloud.

### Internet of Things
People are able to access more information than ever before. It began with __personal digital assistants__ (PDAs), then morphed into smartphones. Now there are smart watches, smart thermostats, even smart refrigerators. Personal computers used to be the norm. Now the internet allows any item that's online-capable to access valuable information. This _ability for devices to garner and then relay information for data analysis_ is referred to as the __Internet of Things__ (IoT).

There are a number of services that can assist and drive end-to-end solutions for IoT on Azure.

Service Name|Description
------------|-----------------
IoT Central|Fully-managed global IoT software as a service (SaaS) solution that makes it easy to connect, monitor, and manage your IoT assets at scale
Azure IoT Hub|Messaging hub that provides secure communications between and monitoring of millions of IoT devices
IoT Edge|Push your data analysis models directly onto your IoT devices, allowing them to react quickly to state changes without needing to consult cloud-based AI models.

### Big Data
Data comes in all formats and sizes. When we talk about Big Data, we're referring to large volumes of data. Data from weather systems, communications systems, genomic research, imaging platforms, and many other scenarios generate hundreds of gigabytes of data. This amount of data makes it hard to analyze and make decisions. It's often so large that traditional forms of processing and analysis are no longer appropriate.

Open source cluster technologies have been developed to deal with these large data sets. Microsoft Azure supports a broad range of technologies and services to provide big data and analytic solutions.

Service Name|Description
----------------|--------------
Azure Synapse Analytics|Run analytics at a massive scale using a cloud-based Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) that leverages massive parallel processing (MPP) to run complex queries quickly across petabytes of data
Azure HDInsight|Process massive amounts of data with managed clusters of Hadoop clusters in the cloud
Azure Databricks|Collaborative Apache Sparkâ€“based analytics service that can be integrated with other Big Data services in Azure.

### Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence, in the context of cloud computing, is based around a broad range of services, the core of which is Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. Using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed.
Forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. For example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might like based on what you've purchased. Or when your credit card is swiped, machine learning compares the transaction to a database of transactions and helps detect fraud. And when your robot vacuum cleaner vacuums a room, machine learning helps it decide whether the job is done.

Some of the most common Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning service types in Azure are:

Service Name|Description
-------------|-----------
Azure Machine Learning Service|Cloud-based environment you can use to develop, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models. It can auto-generate a model and auto-tune it for you. It will let you start training on your local machine, and then scale out to the cloud
Azure Machine Learning Studio|Collaborative, drag-and-drop visual workspace where you can build, test, and deploy machine learning solutions using pre-built machine learning algorithms and data-handling modules

A closely related set of products are the _cognitive services_. These are pre-built APIs you can leverage in your applications to solve complex problems.


Service Name|Description
-------------------|-----------------
Vision|Image-processing algorithms to smartly identify, caption, index, and moderate your pictures and videos.

Bing Search|Add Bing Search APIs to your apps and harness the ability to comb billions of webpages, images, videos, and news with a single API call.
Natural Language processing|Allow your apps to process natural language with pre-built scripts, evaluate sentiment and learn how to recognize what users want.

### DevOps
__DevOps__ (__Development and Operations__) brings together people, processes, and technology, automating software delivery to provide continuous value to your users.

__Azure DevOps Services__ allows you to create build and release pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your applications. You can integrate repositories and application tests, perform application monitoring, and work with build artifacts. You can also work with and backlog items for tracking, automate infrastructure deployment and integrate a range of third-party tools and services such as Jenkins and Chef. All of these functions and many more are closely integrated with Azure to allow for consistent, repeatable deployments for your applications to provide streamlined build and release processes.
