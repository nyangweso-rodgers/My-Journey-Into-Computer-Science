# What is Azure?
__Azure__ is Microsoft's cloud computing platform which gives the freedom to _build_, _manage_, and _deploy_ applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

# Azure Services
# Compute Services
1. __Azure Virtual Machines__: Windows or Linux virtual machines (VMs) hosted in Azure
2. __Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets__: Scaling for Windows or Linux VMs hosted in Azure
3. __Azure Kubernetes Service__:  Enables management of a cluster of VMs that run containerized services
4. __Azure Service Fabric__: Distributed systems platform. Runs in Azure or on-premises
5. __Azure Batch__: Managed service for parallel and high-performance computing applications
6. __Azure Container Instances__: Run containerized apps on Azure without provisioning servers or VMs
7. __Azure Functions__: An event-driven, serverless compute service

# Network Services
Linking compute resources and providing access to applications is the key function of __Azure networking__. Networking functionality in Azure includes a range of options to connect the outside world to services and features in the global Microsoft Azure datacenters. __Azure networking__ facilities have the following features:
1. __Azure Virtual Networ__: Connects VMs to incoming Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections
2, __Azure Load Balance__: Balances inbound and outbound connections to applications or service endpoints
3. __Azure Application Gateway__: Optimizes app server farm delivery while increasing application security
4. __Azure VPN Gateway__: Accesses Azure Virtual Networks through high-performance VPN gateways
5. __Azure DNS__: Provides ultra-fast DNS responses and ultra-high domain availability
6. __Azure Content Delivery Network__: Delivers high-bandwidth content to customers globally
7. __Azure DDoS Protection__: Protects Azure-hosted applications from distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks
8. __Azure Traffic Manager__: Distributes network traffic across Azure regions worldwide
9. __Azure ExpressRoute__: Connects to Azure over high-bandwidth dedicated secure connections
10. __Azure Network Watcher__: Monitors and diagnoses network issues using scenario-based analysis
11. __Azure Firewall__: Implements high-security, high-availability firewall with unlimited scalability
12. __Azure Virtual WAN__: Creates a unified wide area network (WAN), connecting local and remote sites


# Cloud Storage
Azure provides four main types of storage services. These services are:
1. __Azure Blob storage__: Storage service for very large objects, such as video files or bitmaps
2. __Azure File storage__: File shares that you can access and manage like a file server
3. __Azure Queue storage__: A data store for queuing and reliably delivering messages between applications
4. __Azure Table storage__: NoSQL store that hosts unstructured data independent of any schema

# Database Services
Azure provides multiple database services to store a wide variety of data types and volumes. And with global connectivity, this data is available to users instantly.
1. __Azure Cosmos DB__: Globally distributed database that supports NoSQL options
2. __Azure SQL Database__: Fully managed relational database with auto-scale, integral intelligence, and robust security
3. __Azure Database for MySQL__: Fully managed and scalable MySQL relational database with high availability and security
4. __Azure Database for PostgreSQL__: Fully managed and scalable PostgreSQL relational database with high availability and security
5. __SQL Server on VMs__: Host enterprise SQL Server apps in the cloud
6. __Azure Synapse Analytics__: Fully managed data warehouse with integral security at every level of scale at no extra cost
7. __Azure Database Migration Service__: Migrates your databases to the cloud with no application code changes
8. __Azure Cache for Redis__: Caches frequently used and static data to reduce data and application latency
9. __Azure Database for MariaDB__: Fully managed and scalable MariaDB relational database with high availability and security
