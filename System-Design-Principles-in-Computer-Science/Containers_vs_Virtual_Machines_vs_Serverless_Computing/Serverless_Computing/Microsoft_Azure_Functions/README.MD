# Microsoft Azure Functions

# Introduction to Microsoft Azure Functions
* __Microsoft Azure Functions__ is a serverless computing platform that allows developers to create small, single-purpose functions that are triggered by events in the cloud. 

* __Azure Functions__ allows developers to write code in any language they choose and have it run in the cloud without having to manage any servers. This service can be used for many purposes, such as data processing, event handling and backend web services. Functions are event-driven and can be triggered by a variety of Azure services or third party systems such as GitHub, Slack, Twitter, SMS, etc. Functions are easy to develop and deploy. They don't require any long-term commitments or resource allocation.
