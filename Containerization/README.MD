# What are Containers?
__Containers__ allow you to keep your application code contained by wrapping it together with tools and supporting libraries that it needs.

# Why use Containers?
* For developers, __Containers__ mean they can focus on the code and not be concerned where it is deployed. You can get things working the way you want in your own development environment on your workstation and when you are ready to ship, you package the entire thing  up in a __container__ and deploy that to your infrastructure.
* Repeatability
* Deploy the same container
* Deployments and rollbacks are easier
* Operations Team can focus more on the platform
* Scalability
