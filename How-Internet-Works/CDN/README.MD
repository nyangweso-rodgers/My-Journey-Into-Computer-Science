# Introduction to CDN
* A __CDN__ is a large distributed system of “__proxy__” servers deployed across many data centers. A __proxy server__ is just a server that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server.

* Companies with large amounts of distributed traffic can choose to pay __CDN__ companies to deliver their content to their end-users using the CDN’s servers. An example of a __CDN__ is __Akamai__. Akamai has thousands of servers located in strategic geographical locations around the world.

* The main goal is to bring your website’s content closer to your user. If the content doesn’t have to travel as far to get to the user, it means lower latency, which in turn reduces the load time.
