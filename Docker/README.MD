# About Docker
Let's say you created an application which is working fine on your machine. But in __Production__, it doesn't work properly. The _reasons_ could be due to:
* Dependencies
* Libraries and versions
* Framework
* OS level feature
* Microservices

That the developers machinee has but not there in the __production environment__. We need a standardized way to package the application with its __dependencies__  and deploy it on any environment. __Docker__ is a tool designed to make it easier to __create__, __deploy__ and __run__ applications using __containers__.

# How Docker Works
__Docker__ packages an application and all its __dependencies__ in a __virtual container__ that can run on any linux server. Each __container__ runs as an __isolated process__ in the user space and take up __less space__ than regular VMs due to their layered architecture. So it will always work the same regardless of its environment

# What Docker Does
* Carves up a computer into a sealed containers that run developer's code.
* Gets the code to and from your computers
* Build the containers for developers
* Social platform for you to find and share __containers__, which are different from __virtual machines__.

# What is a Container?
__Container__ is a self-contained sealed unit of software. It containes everything required to run your code.
