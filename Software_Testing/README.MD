# Software Testing

# Types of Testing
1. __Unit Testing__: __Unit Testing__ is done by developers - once the __Unit Testing__ status is passed they will share the build with the __QA team__ for further testing. __UNIT TESTING__ is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to _validate that each unit of the software performs as designed_. A __unit__ is the _smallest testable part of any software_. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. In procedural programming, a unit may be an individual program, function, procedure, etc.

    __Benefits of Unit Testing__:
    * Improves the quality of code
    * Restructuring and changes in the code are made easier by the developer and makes the integration easier
    * Bugs in the software are identified and resolved in the early stage in the software development lifecycle
    * As the bugs are identified and resolved at the earliest, time and costs are reduced

2. __Regression Testing__: Let’s assume that there is an application which maintains the details of all the students in school. This application has four buttons __Add__, __Save__, __Delete__ and __Refresh__. All the buttons functionalities are working as expected.

    Recently a new button ‘__Update__’ is added in the application. This ‘__Update__’ button functionality is tested and confirmed that it’s working as expected. But at the same time, it becomes very important to know that the introduction of this new button should not impact the other existing buttons functionality.

    Along with the ‘__Update__’ button, all the other buttons functionality are tested in order to find any new issues in the existing code. This process is known as __regression testing__.
