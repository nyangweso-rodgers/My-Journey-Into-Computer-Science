# Overview Of GitHub Actions
* __GitHub Actions__ is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your:
  * _build_, 
  * _test_, and 
  * _deployment pipeline_. 
  
* You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production. 
* Launched in 2018, __GitHub Actions__ help developers automate their workflowsâ€”all within GitHub. Unlike other automation tools and features, GitHub Actions goes beyond the typical applications of testing, building, and deploying. Instead, it offers the flexibility to automate any __webhook__.

# Setting Up a New GitHub Action Workflow

# Method 1: Using GitHub Interface
* On the GitHub Repo, click on `Actions` on the top navigation bar. This will give you access to the lists of recommended workflows and also an option to create your own workflow.
* Depending on the nature of your project, you can either create a new workflow or use the existing workflow.
* To set up a new workflow, click on `Set up a workflow yourself`. This will take you to a workflow creation screen with a new YAML file named `main.yml`. Once you click on this option, two folders are created alongside the `main.yml` file.
* Inside the `main.yml` file is where you define your workflow, and after writing everything you commit the changes just like your would do when making changes to a repository.
* With this, you have your workflow set and it'll run based on the triggers defined within the YAML file.

# Method 2: Using VS Code
* Clone the repository on your local machine and create a `.github` folder on the root folder of your project.
* Create another folder within the `.github` folder named `workfloows`.
* Add a file with an extension of `.yml` and write your script to it.

# GitHub Actions Components
* __GitHub Actions__ consists of thee Components:
  1. __Workflows__: These are sets of rules that define the automation process. They are defined in the YAML file which is stored in the `.github/workflows` folder.


  2. __Events__: These are what initiate a workflow. For example you can have an event set to run a workflow when a PR is created, or when an issue is opened. To define an event in a workflow, use the keyword `on` followed by the event names. _For example_:

    ```yml
        on:
          issues: 
            types: [opened]
          pull_request_target:
            types: [opened]
    ```

  3. __Jobs__: These are what make up a workflow. Jobs are run concurrently by default. To define your jobs in a given workflow, use the keyword `jobs` followed by a unique identifier for each job and its configuration. _For example_:

    ```yml
      jobs:
        build:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Check out repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - name: Set up Python
              uses: actions/setup-python@v2
              with: 
                python-version: 3.10
            - name: Install dependencies
              run: |
                pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  * All of these components work together to ensure a given set of rules are successfully executed.
