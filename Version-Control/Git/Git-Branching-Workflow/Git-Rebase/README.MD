# Understanding `git rebase`
* `git rebase` is a powerful feature of Git that has the ability to rewrite and reorganize your commit history. `git rebase` allows you to change the base of your branch.
* Unlike `merging`, which _creates a new merge commit and combines the history of both branches_, `rebasing` _replays the commits of one branch onto another_. This results in a linear commit history, making it easier to read and understand.

# How to perform `git rebase`
* While on `new-feature` branch, you will want to do the following:
* Switch to the `main` branch:
  ```sh
        # swithc to main branch
        git checkout main
  ```

* Update your local `main` branch with `git pull`. This is so we have the latest HEAD of `main` available for the rebase.
    ```sh
        # update local branch with git pull
        git pull
    ```

* Switch back to the `new-feature` branch, and use `git rebase main` which will complete the rebase, replaying your commits on top of the HEAD of `main`

# Rebase Best Practices
* While `git rebase` undoubtedly keeps your commit history cleaner, there are a few things to be mindful of:

    * Use `rebase` __ONLY__ for local branches. __DO NOT REBASE branches others are working on__. Rebase changes the commit history, and others will not know about it.
    * Regularly fetch and rebase your local branches to stay up-to-date with the main branch. Conflicts become messy! Rebase early and often.
