# Bitbucket Pages

* __Bitbucket__ offers a service called __Bitbucket Pages__. It allows users to create static websites for their repositories, similar to __GitHub Pages__. With Bitbucket Pages, you can use any static site generator, such as _Jekyll_ or _Hugo_, or even write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files manually.

* To get started with __Bitbucket Pages__, you need to create a branch called __gh-pages__ in your repository, and push your static site files to that branch. Then, you can configure your site settings in the Bitbucket repository settings to enable Bitbucket Pages for your repository. Once enabled, your website will be published at a URL like __< username >.bitbucket.io/< repository-name >__.
