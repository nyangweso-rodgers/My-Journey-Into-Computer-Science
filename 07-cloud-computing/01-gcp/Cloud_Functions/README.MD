# Overview Of Cloud Functions
* __Google Cloud Functions__ is a serverless, event-driven, managed platform for building and connecting cloud services. Itâ€™s a code-centric service where the functions you write can be triggered by an HTTP request or any number of cloud events both on and off Google Cloud.

* With __Cloud Functions__, there are no servers to provision, manage, patch, or update. __Functions__ automatically scale and are highly available and fault-tolerant.__Cloud Functions__ are great for _building serverless backends, doing real-time data processing, and creating intelligent apps_.
