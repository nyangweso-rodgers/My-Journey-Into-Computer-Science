## Binary Trees

### What is a Tree
__Trees__ are similary to __Linked list__ in that they chain together nodes of data, but they do it in a hierarchical rather than in a linear manner.

## Binary Tree
A __binary tree__ is a hierarchy of data with some structure rules. It starts out with a __Root Node__ (_this is a node with no parent_), we can then create a 0, 1,2 e.t.c., children. Therefore, the __binary tree__ has at most two child nodes, thus the name __binary__ and those children are known as the __left__ and __right__ children.

## Binary Search Trees
A __binary search tree__ doesn't change the structural rules of the bianry tree, but they impose additional data rule i.e., all the values in the tree are stored in __Sort Order__.The smallest values are on the left, and the largest values are on the right.

### Adding Item into the Tree
Adding item into the tree is performed by _recursive algorithm_

## Traversals mechanisms
1. In-order traversals - _used when you want to look the items in sort order._
2. pre-order traversals
3. post-order traversal
