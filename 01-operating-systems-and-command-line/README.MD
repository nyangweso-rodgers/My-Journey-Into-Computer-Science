# Definitions of Terms
1. __Kernel__: is the heart of any OS. It's the _piece of software that interacts the closest with the hardware and the rest of the OS sits on top of it_. The Kernel is responsible for low-level tasks such as disk management, memory management, task management, and so on.

2. __Package Manager__: piece of software that allows you to _install, update, and uninstall programs_ from the terminal, just by entering a few commands. All package managers function in a similar way, but there are some differences in the syntax used for each. It's also important to mention that you can install and run a different package manager than the default.
