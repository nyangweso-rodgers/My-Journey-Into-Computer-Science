# Bash Programming Language

## Table Of Contents


# Introduction to Bash
* __Bash__ is a programming language, specifically a _scripting language_, that is used to write shell scripts for the Bash shell.

* __Bash__ is the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS. __Bash scripts__ are commonly used for automating tasks on a Linux or macOS system, such as:
    - configuring system settings, 
    - managing files and directories, and 
    - performing backups.

# Features of Bash
* __Bash__ is an _interpreted language_, i.e.,  _it is executed line-by-line by the shell interpreter_, rather than being compiled into an executable file. 

* Bash scripts are usually saved with the file extension ".sh" and can be run by typing the name of the script file at the command prompt.

# Executing Bash Scripts in Windows without Linux
* Microsoft has included the __Windows Subsystem for Linux__ (WSL) in Windows 10, which allows users to run Linux applications, including the Bash shell, directly in Windows. To use __WSL__, you need to enable it and install a Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store. Once installed, you can launch a Bash shell and run Bash scripts just as you would on a Linux system.

* Another option is to use a third-party tool like __Cygwin__, which provides a Linux-like environment on Windows. Cygwin includes a Bash shell and other Linux utilities, allowing you to run Bash scripts and other Linux applications on Windows.

* Finally, you could use a virtual machine (VM) to run a Linux operating system on top of Windows. This approach requires more setup time and system resources than the previous two options, but it allows you to run Linux and Bash scripts in a completely separate environment from Windows.

# Bash vs. Powershell
* __Bash__ and __PowerShell__ are shells that interpret user commands and execute them,

*  __Bash__ is the default shell for most _Linux distributions_ and _macOS_, while __PowerShell__ is the default shell for _Windows_. While they have some similarities, Bash and PowerShell have different syntax and features.

* __Bash scripts__ are scripts that are _written in the Bash programming language_. These scripts are typically used to automate tasks in a Linux or macOS environment. Bash scripts can be run directly from the command line or scheduled to run at specific times.

* __PowerShell scripts__ are scripts that are _written in the PowerShell programming language_. These scripts are typically used to automate tasks in a Windows environment. PowerShell scripts can be run from the PowerShell command line or scheduled to run at specific times using the Windows Task Scheduler.
