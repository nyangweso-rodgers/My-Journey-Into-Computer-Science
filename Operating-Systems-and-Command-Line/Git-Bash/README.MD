# Introduction to Git Bash
* __Git Bash__ is a terminal emulator for Windows that provides a __Bash shell__ command-line interface to users. It is a part of the Git for Windows package, which includes Git, the popular version control system, as well as a __Bash shell__, command-line utilities, and other tools that are commonly used in Linux and Unix environments.

* __Git Bash__ provides a Unix-like environment on Windows, allowing users to run Bash scripts, use Unix commands, and perform other tasks that are typically done on Linux or Unix systems. Git Bash is based on the __MINGW64__ (Minimalist GNU for Windows 64) project, which provides a collection of Unix tools and utilities for Windows.

* One advantage of using Git Bash is that it provides an easy way for Windows users to use Git, as the Git command-line interface is integrated with the Bash shell. Git Bash also allows users to run Bash scripts and use other Unix tools on a Windows system, without the need to install a separate __Linux distribution__ or __virtual machine__.

* However, it's important to note that Git Bash is not a complete Linux or Unix environment, and there may be some differences between the behavior of Git Bash and a native Linux or Unix environment. Also, some Unix commands or features may not be available or may behave differently in Git Bash, depending on the version of MINGW64 and other factors.


# MINGW64/
* __MINGW64/__ that appears at the beginning of the prompt is the name of the __current directory__, or more specifically, the path to the current directory relative to the root directory of the Git Bash environment.

* The __MINGW64/__ prefix is short for "__Minimalist GNU for Windows 64__," which is the name of the environment in which Git Bash runs. This environment is based on the MINGW64 project, which provides a Unix-like environment on Windows.

* The part of the prompt that comes after the __MINGW64/__ prefix represents the current directory. For example, if you are currently in the Documents directory, the prompt would look like __MINGW64~/Documents$__.
