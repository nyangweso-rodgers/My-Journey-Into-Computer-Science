# SOAP Overview
__SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)__ is a standardized protocal that relies on __XML__ to make _requests_ and _receive_ responses. Even though __SOAP__ is based on __XML__, the __SOAP__ protocol is still in wide usage. __SOAP APIs__ make data available as a service and are typically used when performing transactions involving multiple __API calls__ or applications where security is the primary consideration.

# Working of SOAP
The "S" in __SOAP__ stands for __Simple__, and for a good reason - __SOAP__ can be used with less complexity as it requires less coding in the app layer for transactions, security, and other functions.

# History of SOAP
__SOAP__ was initially developed for __Microsoft__ in __1998__ to provide a standard mechanism for intergrating services on the internet regardless of the operating system, object model, or programming language.

# Characteristics of SOAP
* __Extensibility of SOAP API__: __SOAP__ allows for extensions that introduce more robust features, such as Windows Server Security, Addressing, and more.
* __Neutrality of SOAP API__: __SOAP__ is capable of operating over a wide range of protocols, like UDP, JMS, SMTP, TCP, and HTTP.can operate.
* __Independence of SOAP API__: __SOAP API__ responses are purely based on __XML__. Therefore __SOAP APIs__ are platform and language independent.

# When to Use SOAP API
* __SOAP APIs__ remain a top choice for corporate entities and government organizatins that prioritize security, even though __REST__ has largely dominated web applications.
* __SOAP__ is more secure than __REST__ as it uses __WS-Security__ for transmission along with Secure Socket Layer.
* __SOAP__ also has more excellent transactional reliability, which is another reason why __SOAP__ historically has been favored by the banking industry and other large entities.
