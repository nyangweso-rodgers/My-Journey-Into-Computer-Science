# Overview of Websockets
* __WebSockets__ is a communications protocol that provides dynamic communication over a single __TCP connection__.

# Pros
* __WebSockets__ acts as a thin transport layer that sits on top of your TCP/IP technology stack. With the API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without needing to poll the server for a reply.

# Cons
* The inherent difference between a WebSocket API and a gRPC API is that WebSockets is based on HTTP/1.1 whereas gRPC was built using HTTP/2. It was a natural step to take the technology forward, though thatâ€™s not to say that either one is better. There are pros and cons to both options, and your specific choice should be in line with your needs.
