# AWS Lambda

# Introduction to AWS Lambda
* __AWS Lambda__ is a serverless computing service that makes it possible to build and run applications without provisioning or managing servers.

# Benefits Of AWS Lambda
* Serverless architecture: AWS Lambda will automatically scale up or down as needed without any additional configuration.

* Pay only for what you use: AWS Lambda charges you based on how much time your code spends running, not by the hour or minute.

* Flexible and easy to use: You donâ€™t need to be an expert in server management, AWS Lambda takes care of all of that for you.
