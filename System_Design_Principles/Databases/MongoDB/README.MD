# Overview Of MongoDB
__MongoDB__ is a leading NoSQL document-based database.

# MongoDB Concepts
1. __MongoDB Server__ is a server-side component which can host multiple databases.
2. A __MongoDB database__ is a physical container of collections.
3. A __collection__ in MongoDB is equivalent to a relational database table and it exists within a single database. It includes a group of MongoDB documents.
4. __Document__: includes a set of key value pairs.  All documents include a dynamic schema which means documents which comprise of same collection do not need to have same set of fields and structure.
