# Overview Of BigQuery

# BigQuery Slot
* A __BigQuery__ slot is a _virtual CPU_ used by __BigQuery__ to execute SQL queries. BigQuery automatically calculates how many slots each query requires, depending on query size and complexity.

* If too many complex queries run at the same time, query demands will exceed the slots you committed to.
