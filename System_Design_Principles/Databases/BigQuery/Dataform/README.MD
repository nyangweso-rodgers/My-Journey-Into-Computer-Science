# Overview Of Dataform
* __Dataform__ is a service for data analysts to _develop_, _test_, _version control_, and _schedule complex SQL_ workflows for data transformation in BigQuery.

* __Dataform__ lets you manage data transformation in the _Extraction_, _Loading_, and _Transformation_ (ELT) process for data integration. After raw data is extracted from source systems and loaded into BigQuery, __Dataform__ helps you to transform it into a well-defined, tested, and documented suite of data tables.

* __Dataform__ lets you perform the following data transformation actions:
    - Develop and execute SQL workflows for data transformation.
    - Collaborate with team members on SQL workflow development through Git.
    - Manage a large number of tables and their dependencies.
    - Declare source data and manage table dependencies.
    - Manage data with SQL code in a central repository.
    - Reuse code with JavaScript.
    - Validate data correctness with quality tests on source and output tables.
    - Version control SQL code.
    - Document data tables inside SQL code.
