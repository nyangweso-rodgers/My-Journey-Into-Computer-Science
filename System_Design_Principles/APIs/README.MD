# API Lifecycle
* __API Lifecycle__ provides a clear-cut plan for the entire lifecycle of an API. From a higher level, the __lifecycle of an API__ involves three key phases — __create__, __control__, and __consume__. The following are the 7 stages of an API Lifecycle:

    1. __Design__: An API’s lifecycle starts with planning and designing the API in question. API design includes choosing an _API architecture_, _target audience_, and _API type_ (public, private, or partner). Lastly, API requirements are laid out using an API specification file.

    2. __Develop__: A team of API developers works on implementing the API according to the decisions and specifications in the design plan. An organized development phase includes implementation using a language or framework of choice, debugging, testing and documentation.

    3. __Publish__: At the end of the development phase, it is time to deploy the finished API to development, staging, and production environments. Then, we can make it available to the end-users by publishing it.

    4. __Secure__: The secure phase includes authentication and access control to stop unauthorized access to the API. The API should also be protected against OWASP 10 API security vulnerabilities.

    5. __Discover__: In this phase, the aim is to expose your API to potential consumers to increase adoption. We can call it the monetize phase for cases when you want to sell your API as a product.

    6. __Monitor__: When the API is up and running, it will be connected to multiple consumer applications that rely on it for data. Now the API enters the monitoring phase, where all parameters are checked to ensure the API is working correctly.

    7. __Depreciate__: In the API industry, backward compatibility is a serious concern, which is why older versions must work long enough after newer versions are released. Therefore, after proper planning and monitoring, API enters the last stage, where the older version is retired.
