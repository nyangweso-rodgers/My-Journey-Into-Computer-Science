# What is a Feature Flag?
__Feature flag__ is a software development process used to enable or disable functionality remotely without deploying code. New features can be deployed without making them visible to users. Feature flags help decouple deployment from release letting you manage the full lifecycle of a feature. __Feature flags__ are important becuase of the following reasons:
* _Feature flags make it safer to deploy continuously by separating code changes from revealing features to users._
* _In feature flag during software testing new code can automatically merge and deploy to production and then wait behind a feature flag._
* _When you make a software then the testing phase in enables by Feature Flag, therefore you can say it is most essential for software development process._
* _Flexible code management in there during execution of software testing._
