# Generating Date Arrays
```sql
    with
    dates as (SELECT * FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY('2021-01-01', date_add(current_date(), interval 31 day), INTERVAL 1 day)) AS date),
    -- Excludes Sunday
    daily_sales_days as (select * from dates where FORMAT_DATE('%A',date) <> 'Sunday') 
    
    select * from daily_sales_days
 ```

# Using EXTRACT
Returns the value corresponding to the specified date part.
```sql
    with
    dates as (SELECT * FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY('2021-01-01', date_add(current_date(), interval 31 day), INTERVAL 1 day)) AS date),
    date_parts as (
                    select d.*, 
                    extract(year from date) as year , -- Extract Year
                    extract(month from date) as month , -- Extract Month
                    extract(day from date) as day, -- Extract Day
                    EXTRACT(WEEK(SUNDAY) FROM date) AS week, -- Extract week number -- Week starts on sunday
                    extract(quarter from date) as quarter, -- Extract Quarter
                    extract(dayofweek from date) as day_of_week -- Day of Week
