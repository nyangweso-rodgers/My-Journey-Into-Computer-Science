# Introduction
__Recency-Frequency-Monetary__ (RFM) analysis is a indexing technique that uses past purchase behavior to _segment customers_. Given a table with purchase transaction data, we calculate a score based on _how recently the customer purchased_, _how often they make purchases_ and _how much they spend on average on each purchase_. Using these scores, we can segment our customer list to:
* identify our most loyal customers by segmenting one-time buyers from customers with repeat purchases
* increase customer retention and lifetime value
* increase average order size, etc.
