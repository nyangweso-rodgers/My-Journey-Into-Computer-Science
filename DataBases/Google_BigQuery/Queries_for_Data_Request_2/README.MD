# Accounting for a Customer Advance
When a __seller__ receives an advance payment before the delivery of goods/services, the correct accounting is to recognize the advance as a liability, until such a time the seller fulfills its obligations under the terms of the underlying agreement. Two __journal entries__ are involved, i.e.,
1. _Initial recordation_: __Debit__ the cash account and __credit__ the customer advances (liability) account
2. _Revenue recognition_: __Debit__ the the customer advances (liability) account and credit the revenue account

# Example of the Accounting for a Customer Advance
For example, Green Widget Company receives $10,000 from a customer for a customized purple widget. Green Widget records the receipt with a debit of $10,000 to the cash account and a credit of $10,000 to the customer advances account. In the next month, Green delivers the custom widget, and creates a new journal entry that debits the customer advances account for $10,000 and credits the revenue account for $10,000.
